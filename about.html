  <header> <h2>History</h2> </header>

  <p class="cityInformation">Evliya Çelebi's Seyahatnâme gives information about the region that in the mountains and towns mostly reside Turkmens who originally migrated from Bukhara.[12][13] Elbistan was known as "vilayet-i Türkmân" in the Ottoman documents.[14]
The city used to be the capital city of the Dulkadirids after capturing from Eretnids in 1337. In 1277 the Mamluks led by Sultan Baibars defeated a Mongol army in the Battle of Elbistan. The region was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire shortly before the campaign against the Mameluks of Egypt in 1512, although some local chiefdoms were given varying degrees of autonomy, notably around the localities of Haticepınar and Kasanlı.</p></br>

 <header> <h2>Etymology</h2> </header>

<p class="cityInformation">The name "Elbistan" was pronounced similarly in Byzantine and Islamic sources. Elbistan was known as Ablasta (Armenian: Աբլաստա) according to Armenian historians in the early 11th century. According to Baldric of Dol the city was known as "Ablistan" till 15th century. Egyptian-Mamluk historian Muhammad ibn Iyas wrote the city's name as "Albistan". Alaüddevle Bozkurt Bey from Dulkadirids used the name "Elbistan" in the official documents. After Dulkadirids decided to join the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, the current name became prevalent. Among the rural people of Elbistan it is pronounced as "Albıstan". Albistan means "the orchard" in Arabic however Turks claiming that the name derives from the word "Elbostan" which means also "the orchard".[15]</p>
